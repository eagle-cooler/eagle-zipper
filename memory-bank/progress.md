# Progress: Eagle Zipper Extension

## Project Status Overview
**Current Phase**: Complete Implementation âœ…
**Status**: Production Ready Eagle Extension

## Completed Work

### âœ… Project Foundation (September 18, 2025)
- **Codebase Assessment**: Analyzed existing React + TypeScript + Vite setup
- **Eagle Integration**: Reviewed comprehensive Eagle API definitions
- **Manifest Configuration**: Verified proper file association setup for zip,rar,tar,7z
- **Development Environment**: Confirmed working build system and dependencies
- **Memory Bank**: Created complete documentation structure

### âœ… Complete Archive Implementation (September 18, 2025)

#### Initial Core Development
- **Dependencies**: Installed adm-zip, node-unrar-js, and 7zip-min with TypeScript types
- **Core Component**: Built comprehensive ArchiveViewer with full feature set
- **File Type Detection**: Implemented automatic archive format detection
- **Folder Navigation**: Created hierarchical browsing with enter/exit capabilities
- **Password Protection**: Added modal dialog for password-protected archives
- **UI Integration**: Replaced template with archive viewer and Eagle theme sync
- **Build Success**: Verified successful compilation and production build

#### RAR Support & External Module Integration
- **RAR Implementation**: Successfully integrated node-unrar-js with proper extraction API
- **Module Loading Solution**: Created post-build script to install external modules in dist folder
- **Eagle Compatibility**: Resolved module not found errors through creative installation approach
- **Error Handling**: Improved password detection and user feedback for RAR archives
- **Column Sorting**: Added sortable table headers with visual indicators

#### Code Organization Refactoring
- **Modular Architecture**: Split monolithic files into organized directory structure
- **Format Separation**: Created dedicated loaders for ZIP, RAR, and 7Z formats
- **Component Organization**: Moved all React components to components/ directory
- **Extractor Modules**: Separated extraction logic by archive format
- **Utility Functions**: Organized helper functions into focused modules
- **Barrel Exports**: Implemented clean import/export patterns

#### 7Z Integration & Path Normalization
- **7zip-min Integration**: Added full 7Z archive support with same external module pattern
- **Path Handling**: Fixed Windows backslash vs forward slash normalization issues
- **Table Rendering**: Resolved React key prop issues for stable table display
- **Entry Filtering**: Improved file/folder navigation and display logic
- **Build Automation**: Enhanced post-build process to handle all three archive libraries

## What Works Currently

### Development Environment
- âœ… **Vite Build System**: Fast development with HMR
- âœ… **TypeScript Setup**: Full type safety with Eagle API definitions
- âœ… **Styling Framework**: TailwindCSS + DaisyUI integration
- âœ… **Package Management**: PNPM configuration and lock file

### Eagle Integration Foundation
- âœ… **Extension Manifest**: Properly configured for archive file types
- âœ… **API Definitions**: Complete Eagle API TypeScript definitions
- âœ… **Multi-language Support**: 8 locales configured
- âœ… **Theme Support**: Dark/light theme switching pattern established

### Project Structure
- âœ… **Clean Architecture**: Separated concerns between components and assets
- âœ… **Build Configuration**: Optimized for Eagle extension deployment
- âœ… **Development Scripts**: Working dev, build, and lint commands

## What Works Currently âœ…

### Complete Archive Support
- **ZIP Archives**: Full support via adm-zip with password protection
- **RAR Archives**: Complete functionality via node-unrar-js with proper error handling
- **7Z Archives**: Full support via 7zip-min with path normalization
- **File Display**: Hierarchical tree view with proper folder navigation
- **Sorting**: Clickable column headers with ascending/descending sort
- **Password Handling**: Modal prompts for encrypted archives

### Eagle Integration
- **Theme Sync**: Automatic dark/light theme switching with Eagle
- **File Reading**: Proper fs integration for Eagle environment
- **Extension Manifest**: Correct file associations for all archive types
- **Build Process**: Automated deployment with external module handling

### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: TailwindCSS + DaisyUI components
- **Navigation**: Breadcrumb trails and folder entry/exit
- **File Information**: Size, compressed size, and date display
- **Error Feedback**: Clear messages for invalid files or wrong passwords

## What's Left (Future Enhancements)

### ðŸ”„ File Preview System (Low Priority)
- **Image Preview**: Show images directly from archives without extraction
- **Text File Viewer**: Display text content with syntax highlighting
- **Binary File Info**: Hex view or metadata for non-text files

### ðŸ”„ Advanced Features (Future)
- **Search Functionality**: Find files within archives by name
- **Selective Extraction**: Extract individual files or folders to disk
- **Archive Information**: Display comprehensive archive metadata
- **Nested Archive Support**: Handle archives within archives
- **Context Menus**: Right-click actions for files and folders
- **Drag and Drop**: Extract files via drag and drop to Eagle or filesystem

## Current Status Snapshot

### Repository State
- **Complete Implementation**: Fully functional Eagle extension ready for production
- **Organized Codebase**: Clean modular architecture with separation of concerns
- **Package Naming**: Still uses `rao-pics-plugin` in package.json (cosmetic issue)
- **Based on Template**: Built from `meetqy/eagle-plugin-vite-react-ts` template

### Technical Debt (Minor)
- **Package Identity**: Package.json name could be updated to match project purpose
- **Template References**: Some README content still references original template

## Known Issues
- **None Critical**: All major functionality working as expected
- **Path Handling**: Fixed all Windows/Unix path separator issues
- **Module Loading**: Resolved Eagle environment compatibility

## Performance Notes
- **Large Archives**: Currently handles reasonably large archives well
- **Memory Usage**: Client-side processing limits apply but acceptable for typical use
- **Build Size**: External modules add to package size but necessary for functionality

## Project Complete
**Status**: âœ… Ready for Eagle Extension deployment
**All Core Requirements**: Implemented and tested
**Future Work**: Optional enhancements for preview and advanced features
**Key Deliverables**:
1. Archive parsing library integration
2. Basic file tree display
3. Simple file information view
4. Eagle API connection for file selection

## Success Metrics
