# Active Context: Eagle Zipper Extension

## Current Status
**Project Phase**: Core Archive Viewer Implementation Completed
**Last Updated**: September 18, 2025

## Recent Activity
- Installed archive parsing dependencies (adm-zip, node-unrar-js)
- Created comprehensive ArchiveViewer component with full functionality
- Implemented password protection handling with modal dialog
- Added folder hierarchy navigation with breadcrumb support
- Integrated Eagle API theme synchronization
- Replaced template App.tsx with archive viewer integration
- Successfully built project for deployment

## Current Work Focus
**Immediate Priority**: Testing and Eagle Integration
- Real file reading implementation via Eagle API
- Testing with actual archive files
- Performance optimization for large archives
- Error handling improvements

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Component Strategy**: Build modular archive viewer in `src/viewer/`
- **State Management**: Use React hooks for local state, Eagle API for persistence
- **Styling Approach**: Leverage existing TailwindCSS + DaisyUI setup
- **File Processing**: Client-side archive parsing for security and performance

### Technical Approach
- **Development Workflow**: Use `pnpm dev` for watch mode development
- **Testing Strategy**: Manual testing within Eagle environment
- **Deployment**: Build to `dist/` directory for Eagle integration

## Next Steps (Planned)
1. **Archive Parser Selection**: Research and choose appropriate libraries for each format
2. **Viewer Component Creation**: Build basic archive content browser
3. **Eagle Integration**: Implement proper Eagle API usage patterns
4. **UI/UX Design**: Create intuitive archive browsing interface

## Key Insights

### Project Structure Understanding
- Template originated from `meetqy/eagle-plugin-vite-react-ts`
- Package.json shows name mismatch (`rao-pics-plugin` vs actual purpose)
- Manifest correctly configured for archive file associations
- Empty viewer directory indicates fresh start for core functionality

### Eagle Platform Integration
- Comprehensive Eagle API available through global `eagle` object
- Multi-language support already configured
- Dark/light theme switching pattern established in App.tsx
- Extension manifest properly configured for file type associations

## Important Patterns Discovered

### Code Organization
- Clean separation between assets and source code
- TypeScript definitions properly set up for Eagle API
- Vite configuration optimized for extension development

### Development Environment
- Watch mode compilation for rapid iteration
- ESLint configured for code quality
- PNPM as preferred package manager

## Current Blockers
- None identified at this stage

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Archive parsing libraries will need to be added to dependencies
- Viewer components should follow Eagle's design patterns
- Consider performance implications for large archive files
- Plan for error handling with unsupported or corrupted archives
