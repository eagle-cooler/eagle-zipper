# Active Context: Eagle Zipper Extension

## Current Status
**Project Phase**: Production Ready with Complete Editing Feature
**Last Updated**: September 21, 2025

## Recent Major Changes

### Phase 1: Core Implementation (Initial)
- Installed archive parsing dependencies (adm-zip, node-unrar-js, 7zip-min)
- Created comprehensive ArchiveViewer component with full functionality
- Implemented password protection handling with modal dialog
- Added folder hierarchy navigation with breadcrumb support
- Integrated Eagle API theme synchronization
- Replaced template App.tsx with archive viewer integration

### Phase 2: RAR Support & Bug Fixes
- **RAR Support**: Successfully integrated node-unrar-js with proper Eagle environment setup
- **Module Loading**: Implemented creative solution for external modules (manual dist installation)
- **Error Handling**: Fixed various RAR extraction and password handling issues
- **Column Sorting**: Added clickable table headers with sort indicators
- **File Extraction**: Optimized extraction logic for all formats

### Phase 3: Code Organization Refactoring
- **Directory Structure**: Split monolithic files into organized modular architecture
- **Format-Specific Files**: Separated ZIP, RAR, and 7Z logic into dedicated modules
- **Component Organization**: Moved React components to dedicated components/ directory
- **Utility Separation**: Created focused utility modules for specific concerns

### Phase 4: 7Z Integration & Path Fixes
- **7zip-min Integration**: Added 7Z support with same external module pattern
- **Path Normalization**: Fixed Windows backslash vs forward slash path issues
- **Table Indexing**: Resolved React key prop issues for proper table rendering
- **Entry Filtering**: Improved file/folder display logic for proper navigation

### Phase 5: Complete ZIP Editing Implementation (September 20-21, 2025)
- **Full ZIP Editing**: Complete implementation of ZIP file editing with Eagle API integration
- **Context Menu**: Right-click "Edit File" functionality for ZIP archives
- **File Extraction System**: SHA256-based temp directory management with proper cleanup
- **File Monitoring**: Debounced file watcher with manual update controls
- **Session Management**: Per-archive editing session registry preventing conflicts
- **UI Refinement**: Non-blocking alert bar interface with "Finish Editing" workflow
- **Path Resolution**: Fixed nested file path handling for proper file opening
- **Eagle Integration**: Complete item.replaceFile() workflow with proper notifications

## Current Work Focus
**Status**: Production Ready Extension with Complete Feature Set
- All four archive formats (ZIP, RAR, 7Z, TAR) viewing supported
- Complete ZIP editing workflow implemented
- Per-archive session management preventing conflicts
- Clean non-blocking editing interface
- Organized codebase with clean separation of concerns
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Eagle integration complete

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Component Strategy**: Modular archive viewer with editing capabilities in `src/viewer/`
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state, Eagle API for persistence
- **Styling Approach**: TailwindCSS + DaisyUI with non-blocking alert interfaces
- **File Processing**: Client-side archive parsing with temp directory editing
- **Session Management**: Static registry pattern for per-archive editing sessions
- **Path Handling**: OS-specific path joining with ZIP-compatible internal paths

### Technical Approach
- **Development Workflow**: Use `pnpm dev` for watch mode development
- **Testing Strategy**: Manual testing within Eagle environment
- **Deployment**: Build to `dist/` directory for Eagle integration

## Next Steps (Planned)
1. **Archive Parser Selection**: Research and choose appropriate libraries for each format
2. **Viewer Component Creation**: Build basic archive content browser
3. **Eagle Integration**: Implement proper Eagle API usage patterns
4. **UI/UX Design**: Create intuitive archive browsing interface

## Key Insights

### Project Structure Understanding
- Template originated from `meetqy/eagle-plugin-vite-react-ts`
- Package.json shows name mismatch (`rao-pics-plugin` vs actual purpose)
- Manifest correctly configured for archive file associations
- Empty viewer directory indicates fresh start for core functionality

### Eagle Platform Integration
- Comprehensive Eagle API available through global `eagle` object
- Multi-language support already configured
- Dark/light theme switching pattern established in App.tsx
- Extension manifest properly configured for file type associations

## Important Patterns Discovered

### Code Organization
- Clean separation between assets and source code
- TypeScript definitions properly set up for Eagle API
- Vite configuration optimized for extension development

### Development Environment
- Watch mode compilation for rapid iteration
- ESLint configured for code quality
- PNPM as preferred package manager

## Current Blockers
- None identified at this stage

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Archive parsing libraries will need to be added to dependencies
- Viewer components should follow Eagle's design patterns
- Consider performance implications for large archive files
- Plan for error handling with unsupported or corrupted archives
